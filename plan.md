# Fraud Detection PoC Plan (Graph-Driven)

## Overview

This document outlines a hybrid fraud detection approach leveraging Aerospike Graph DB, demonstrating both real-time and batch-based detection. The goal is to showcase the power of graph traversal, pattern recognition, and risk scoring using transaction data.

---

## üéØ Goals

* Highlight **graph traversal capabilities** for fraud detection
* Split detection into **Realtime (low-latency)** and **Batch (deep pattern mining)**
* Use **graph-native queries** to uncover suspicious patterns

---

## üîÅ Detection Modes

### Realtime Detection

**Objective:** Assess each incoming transaction using:

* 1‚Äì2 hop graph lookups
* Cached fraud scores
* Lightweight risk signals

### Batch Detection

**Objective:** Periodic scan of full transaction graph to:

* Identify multi-transaction and multi-hop fraud patterns
* Score accounts based on graph analytics

## üõ† Realtime Detection Plan

### Flow:

1. Receive transaction via API
2. Lookup `fraud_score:{account_id}`
3. Run 1-hop Gremlin query:

```gremlin
g.V(account_id).out('transfers_to').has('flagged', true).limit(1)
```

4. Optionally check:

```gremlin
g.V(account_id).out('transfers_to').groupCount().unfold().count()
```

5. Compute risk score and flag if threshold is crossed

### Fast Signals:

* Connection to known fraudsters
* Abnormally high out-degree
* Cached fraud score from batch

---

## üóÉ Batch Detection Plan

### Flow:

1. Ingest all transactions (past 1‚Äì6 hrs)
2. Traverse the graph to:

   * Find multi-hop suspicious paths
   * Detect cycles
   * Identify fan-out / structuring
3. Annotate vertex properties:

   * `fraud_score`
   * `cycle_score`
   * `dormancy_flag`
4. Persist results for realtime lookup

### Example Queries:

**BT4 - Money hop in 3 hops within 1 hour**

```gremlin
g.V().hasLabel('account')
 .repeat(__.outE('transfers_to').has('timestamp', P.gt(cutoff)).inV())
 .times(3)
 .path()
 .limit(100)
```

**BT5 - Cycle detection**

```gremlin
g.V().hasLabel('account')
 .repeat(__.out('transfers_to').simplePath()).emit().times(4)
 .where(__.loops().is(P.gte(3)))
 .path()
```

## üìä Visualization (Optional but Recommended)

* Use D3.js or Vis.js to show:

  * Flagged account neighborhood
  * Suspicious path traversals
  * Heatmap of fraud clusters

---

## üì¶ PoC Deliverables

### Backend

* Realtime fraud scoring API (Python)
* Batch fraud scoring job (Python/Cron/Airflow)
* Graph queries integrated via Gremlin

### Data

* Simulated transactions (with fraud seeds)
* Seed graph with users, accounts, and edges

### Frontend (Optional)

* Dashboard: flagged transactions, scores, graphs
* Account drill-down: neighbors, transactions, alerts
